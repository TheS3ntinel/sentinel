            <p>We live in a world where everything you read, watch, and hear is curated for you by algorithms. These algorithms are controlled by those with less than admirable and nefarious agendas. They use their algorithms to seduce, then hook you
              into a dopamine addiction trap. Where they can then manipulate and corrupt your natural train of thought with lies, half-truths, and bandwagon fallacies, eroding your ability to think for yourself. </p>
            <p>These dopamine traps simplify and "dumb down" your ability to think rationally and with logic, trapping you into a world where up is down, wrong is right, truth are lies, reason is insanity, and logic is abstract, all so your fantasy,
              or false reality, can fuel and empower their reality. </p>
            <p>If you think this is crazy, ask yourself this. Have you ever heard or read something from someone you subscribe to or follow saying or endorsing something popular, mainstream, or trendy that you knew or thought was a flat-out lie,
              incorrect, or extreme? </p>
            <p>If you think this is crazy, ask yourself this. Have you ever heard or read something from someone you subscribe to or follow saying or endorsing something popular, mainstream, or trendy that you knew or thought was a flat-out lie,
              incorrect, or extreme? </p>
            <p>Most of you probably went along with the trend, because thinking for yourself and having differing opinions makes you eligible for public ostracization and scrutiny. So you went along with the fallacy, because your addiction to these
              dopamine traps does not allow for ostracization, scrutiny, or banishment because you must have more. </p>
            <p>Who are they? And what are these dopamine traps? They are big tech elitists and globalists. These dopamine traps are Facebook, Twitter, Instigram, YouTube, and any other social media platform that curates its propaganda for your
              consumption. </p>
            <p>These big tech social media platforms fuel themselves with your data. They offer "free products" that are undeniably useful and enticing. But there is a problem. These products are not free. In fact, they are not even products. You are
              the product, and you are not free. They collect and sell your personal data to advertisers, who then feed your dopamine needs with the same ads they sold you while lying and manipulating you. </p>
            <p>They feed on you like parasites, collecting astronomical amounts of personal data that is then used against you. They are adversaries of life, liberty, and happiness, and they know where you are, where you're going, and where you've
              been. They know who you know and how you know them. They know what you like, love, and hate. If you can think of it, they know it about you. And this kind of data in the right ( or wrong ) hands could ruin your life, or even be
              life-threatening. </p>
            <p>We no longer live in an age of information. We live in an age that was once science fiction, an age where truth are lies and lies are truth. We are living in the Cyberpunk age. But not all hope is lost. You can secure your privacy and
              free your mind from the many traps that plauge your life and the internet. </p>
            <p>No one is going to do it for you. Freeing yourself from big tech and manipulation can be difficult for some and easy for others. You may run into complications in finding alternatives and what works for you. But if you keep trying, you
              can be free from prying eyes, data collection, ads, data breaches, and manipulation. Your data is you. Protect it as you would protect yourself. </p>
            <p>I have provided a links page where you can find many projects, communities, and creators dedicated to helping people take their privacy back and reclaim their mental freedom. </p>
            <p>And remember, they are watching... But so is he. God bless you, and may you triumph over those seeking to enslave and destroy you. </p>
